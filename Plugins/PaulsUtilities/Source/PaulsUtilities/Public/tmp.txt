Are you alright?
KoiYesterday at 2:13 AM
Yup.  Was catching up with some things.
Ma kept me over all day.
LuneshadeYesterday at 2:14 AM
Oh, good to hear.
Did Kat message you at all?
I'll probably message her through an alt account soon. I'm just really worried, she's been afk all day.
KoiYesterday at 2:14 AM
I've gotten to talk to her a bit.
LuneshadeYesterday at 2:14 AM
I just wanted to make sure she's alright
KoiYesterday at 2:15 AM
Aww.
I'd say not perfect but she's alive and not showing signs of suicidal thoughts or the like if you're worried about that.
And no that's not meant to imply anything.
LuneshadeYesterday at 2:17 AM
That's good enough then, I suppose.
KoiYesterday at 2:18 AM
I won't say you should/shouldn't do what you were thinking of, this kind of thing's out of my area of expertise.
LuneshadeYesterday at 2:18 AM
That's fine. I wasnt planning to drag you into this anymore.
I really just wanted to know that she's alright.
